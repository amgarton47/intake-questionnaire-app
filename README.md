# Bioverse Intake System

This project is my submission for the Bioverse take-home assignment. It is a simple intake questionnaire web app that allows users to fill out questionnaires, view their progress, and interact with multiple choice or input-style questions. Administrators can view user responses and manage the questionnaires.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** (React framework)
- **Tailwind CSS** (for styling)
- **Supabase** (for database and authentication)
- **JavaScript** (for frontend logic)

## Features

- Users can view and fill out questionnaires.
- Admin users can see all submitted answers from users.
- Login page for user authentication.
- Different question types: Multiple Choice (single or multiple answers) and Text Input.
- Responses are stored and categorized by questionnaire.
